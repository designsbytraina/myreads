# MyReads: a Book Manager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**MyReads** was created as part of *Udacity's React Nanodegree Program* and fulfills the MyReads application rubric.

## Project Description

The application contains two main routes (`/`, `/search`) which allow for a user to add and manage their books in a virtual library of shelves: *Currently Reading*, *Read Later*, and *Completed*.

When a user enters the application, their shelves are displayed, where they can move or remove books from their library. Navigating to the search page allows for a user to search for new books and manage each book's read status.

### TODO

The search page currently only allows for queries by book title. This should be resolved in the next version.

## Running the Project

Before starting the project, you will need to add the required scripts to your project. These dependencies are noted in `package.json` and can be added to your project by running:

```
$ npm install
```

Once dependencies are installed and you're ready to start the project, you can run:

```
$ npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
